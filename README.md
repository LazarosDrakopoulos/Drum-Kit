# Drum-Kit-Challenge

The 'Drum Kit' project is an interactive web application designed to simulate a drum kit experience, crafted during a Udemy course. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application offers users the ability to produce drum sounds by either clicking on virtual drum buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. Each button or key triggers a distinct drum sound, ranging from tom-tom beats to crash cymbals.
